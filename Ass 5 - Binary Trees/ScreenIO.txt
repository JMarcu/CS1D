*   ASSIGNMENT #5 : Binary Trees
******************************************************

This program is designed to test the implementation of a binary tree ADT. It 
uses hardcoded input to construct and traverse a binary tree.

The tree is empty

Adding 'A' to the binary tree.
Adding 'B' to the binary tree.
Adding 'C' to the binary tree.
Adding 'D' to the binary tree.
Adding 'E' to the binary tree.
Adding 'F' to the binary tree.
Adding 'G' to the binary tree.

The tree is not empty
The tree has 7nodes
Inorder Traversal: A B D F C E G 
Preorder Traversal: A B D F C E G 
Postorder Traversal: D F B E G C A 

Program has finished and will now exit.
