Welcome. This program will ask you for algebraic expressions and will tell you 
if you have used the correct number and type of grouping symbols (i.e. '(', '[', 
and '{'). You may enter as many expressions into the program as you like.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): (2x + 5) (6x+4)
This expression's use of grouping symbols is valid.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): [(8x+5) - 4x[9x+3]]
This expression's use of grouping symbols is valid.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): {(8x+5) - 5x[9x+3]}
This expression's use of grouping symbols is valid.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): (((8x+5) - x[9x+3])))
This expression's use of grouping symbols is invalid.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): {(8x+5) - 6x[9x+3]]
This expression's use of grouping symbols is invalid.

Please enter an expression to check ('exit' to quit): {2x+3} {7x+8}
This expression's use of grouping symbols is valid.
