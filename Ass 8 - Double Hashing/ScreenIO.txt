This program serves to test the implementation of a map. A series of key/value 
pairs are being added to it, and the final result will be output. Then all keys 
will be deleted and the map will be output one last time.

This is the map after all additions and erasures: 
Orange, Tustin, Brea, EMPTY, Laguna Beach, Los Angeles, Oceanside, Mission 
Viejo, San Clemente, Palms Springs, Irvine, La Jolla, Santa Ana, Aliso Viejo, 
Riverside, San Diego, Del Mar

This is the map after all remaining entries were manually removed: 
EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, 
EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY, EMPTY

Program has finished and will now exit.
